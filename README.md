Sales Analysis of Global superstore

Project Overview:

In this portfolio project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data from Global Superstore using Power BI. The objective was to identify patterns and trends in the data and highlight areas for improvement. To achieve this, I followed a structured approach and employed various data transformation techniques and visualizations.

Data Loading and Transformation:

The first step involved loading the Global Superstore data into Power BI using the Power Query Editor. I performed essential data transformations, such as rounding numerical values, extracting the year from date fields, and creating conditional columns based on specific criteria. These initial steps ensured that the data was clean and well-structured for further analysis.

Data Analysis:

To gain meaningful insights from the data, I utilized DAX functions, such as COUNT, SUM, and DISTINCTSUM. These functions allowed me to perform calculations and aggregations on the data, enabling a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs).

Visualizations:

To effectively communicate the findings, I designed various charts and cards to visualize the analyzed data. These visualizations served to highlight the key metrics and trends in an intuitive manner, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp important information.

Advanced Visualization Features:

To enhance the flexibility and interactivity of the Power BI report, I utilized advanced visualization features, including field parameters, page navigation, and the ability to clear all slicers. These features provided users with greater control and the ability to customize their exploration of the data.
